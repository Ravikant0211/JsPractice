### Definition

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the SOLID Principles in object oriented programming.
- It states that no code should be forced to depend on the methods it doesn't use.
- ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller ones, so that the code only need to know about
  about the methods that are of interest to it.
- ISP intends to make the system decoupled, thus easier to refactor, change and redeploy.

### Definition

- The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern, that allows you to create new object by copying 
an existing object, known as prototype.

- It is useful when the process of creating new similar objects is costly.

- It makes the code more memory efficient.

- A real-world example could be a document template system, where you create a document from a prototype, such as creating invoices, reports, or resumes that share similar structures but have different data.

##### Usecases

- Object Initialization is costly
- Creating objects with similar properties
- Reducing subclassing
- Creating immutable objects

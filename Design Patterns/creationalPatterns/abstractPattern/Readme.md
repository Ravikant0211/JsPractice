### Definition

- Abstract design pattern is a creational design pattern, which provides you with an interface to create
different similar kind of objects without knowing the concrete class going to be instantiated. 

- The Abstract pattern is similar to Factory pattern; the only difference is that it provides a constructor
to create objects with the 'new' keyword.


###### When to use

- applications requiring the reuse or sharing of objects

- applications with complex logic because they have multiple families of related objects that need to be used together

- object caching

- when the object creation process is to be shielded from the client

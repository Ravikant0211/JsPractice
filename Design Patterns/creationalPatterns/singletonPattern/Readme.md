### Definition

- The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access point to the instance. 

- This pattern is mainly used when you need to control access to some shared resources like database connections, and logging services etc.

- The instance is often created when it is first needed rather than initializing when the application first 
setup.

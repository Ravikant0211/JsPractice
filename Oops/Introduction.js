// what is OOPs?
// Object oriented programming is a style of programming, which involves
// breaking a program into segments of objects that can communicate with
// each other.

// OOPs in javascript
// - can be implemented without using 'class' keyword
// - relied on 'Prototype-based programming'. 
// - Object encaptulates the properties instead of a class.
// - Object don't need to be an instance of a class.

// Prototype-based programming
// - No need to create blueprint beforehand
// - Object can be created directly- no need to use class.
// - Risk of incorrectness

// What does ES6 offer?
// 1. 'class' Keyword-
// In ES5 version, there are no classes; a function is used to
// make objects directly. 
// In ES6 version, 'class' keyword is used.

// 2. getter/setter syntax
// In ES6, the object properties require get/set methods to be
// called to access/modify their values.

// 3. 'constructor' function syntax
// In the ES5. 'function' keyword is used to declare a constructor function.
// In ES6, 'constructor' keyword is used to declare a constructor function.

// 4. 'extends' keyword
// In ES6, 'extends' keyword is used to set up the protypal inheritance.
// between parent and child class.

// 5. 'super' keyword
// In ES6, 'super' is used to call the constructor on the parent object
// that is being inherited by the child.

// 6. 'static' keyword
// In ES6, static members are declared using 'static' keyword.
